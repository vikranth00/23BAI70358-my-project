This project make small simple ticket booking system using Node.js and Express server.
User can check all seats, then choose and lock one seat, later confirm the booking properly.
When seat is locked, it stay only for one full minute, after that lock expire and seat become free again.
System also stop many users from booking same seat together at same time, so no double booking happen.
It show clear message when lock success, when lock expire, or when seat already booked by other person.
